\section{Problem 4}

\subsection{Problem}

Now the relationships in the network has a weight indicating 
how string a relationship between two persons is. The problem 
to solve for this algorithm is finding a path between two nodes 
in the network that has the weakest relationships along the way.
If the algorithm is to find a chain of friends from $p_i$ to $p_j$,
it must choose a chain where the sum of the weight of the edges along 
the path is the least. The pseudocode can 
be seen in figure \ref{fig:shortchain}.

\subsection{Algorithm}

To solve the problem, one can almost just use Dijkstra
shortest path algorithm as it is. If the algorithm is run
and, afterwards, the path from $p_1$ to $p_2$ can be found
by following the nodes pointed to by starting from $o_2$ and 
take the reverse order. The pseudocode can 
be seen in figure \ref{fig:shortpathcode}.

\begin{algorithmic}
\Function{svagestevenskab}{P, V, p1, p2} 
\State $G = $ \Call{incidentList}{P,V}
\State \Call{Dijkstra}{G, p1}
\State $N = \{p2\}$
\State $n = p2$
\While{$n.\pi \neq null$}
\State $N.$\Call{add}{$n.\pi$}
\State $n = n.\pi$
\EndWhile
\State \Return $N.$\Call{reverse}{}
\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Complexity}

Folowing the path adds at most $P$ operations, and so does revering.
Thus besides from the Dijkstra's algorithm itself, only $2P$ operations
are added. Thus, he runtime is: 

\begin{align*}
T(P, V, p1, p2) &= T_{Dijkstra} \left( G, p1 \right) + c_1 \cdot 2 |P|\\
 &= \Theta \left( |P| + |V| \right)
\end{align*}
